# Hello 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space where I blend technology and education to create impactful learning experiences. As a Learning Technology Specialist at the American Museum of Natural History, I manage and optimize the Moodle LMS to enhance both our online and physical educational programs. I'm passionate about making learning accessible and engaging through technology.

In addition to my role at the museum, I have also enriched my teaching experience as a Data Science Teaching Assistant at CUNY Tech Prep. Here, I've guided students through the nuances of Python, data science, and machine learning, preparing them to tackle real-world challenges. My background in business administration and data analytics helps me bridge the gap between technical expertise and strategic implementation in educational settings.
